# React Pokemon API App
This app uses Express.js and React to handle requests to the pokeapi.co pokemon api and display response data. <br />
The app uses a form component to receive a pokemon name from the user. <br />
On submit, it sends a request using the input value in the endpoint, to receive data on that pokemon. <br />
It displays the image, stats and abilities using React state.

## Additions
Error message functionality to be added. Currently if a name is submitted that does not recieve a valid response from the api, simply nothing happens.
